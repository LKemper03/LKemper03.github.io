Ergonomics components mounted in the chassis assembly.

## Seat Design

Top: Driver's seat final model <br>
Left: Reference image for seat shape <br>
Right: Seat side view <br>
The side view profile of the seat was created using the reference image of a driver seated in the chassis. The front view seat profile was created using 5th percentile female and 95th percentile male body measurements provided by FSAE.

## Steering Wheel Design

The steering wheel shape was based on a previous design, refined to save weight and increase visibility of the dashboard.

## Firewall Design
{% include image-gallery.html images="Firewall 2324 iso view.png, Firewall 2324 section assembly.png, Firewall 2324 section assembly side view.png" height="400" %}
Top: Complete firewall assembly <br>
Left: Firewall assembly mounted in chassis with electronic components visible on the right <br>
Right: Isometric view of firewall in chassis. Side of firewall was sealed against body panels
The firewall was designed to allow mounting of electronics under the seat. The rectangular panel in the center is removable to allow for the main battery to be removed when the seat is taken out.

## Seating Position

The circular sketch is the driver template used in FSAE competition technical inspection, which must pass clearance tests outlined in the competition regulations. All ergonomic component designs are based around this template.
