## ANSYS Seat Analysis
### Technical Inspection Load

Left: Applied forces and fixtures used for simulation. Bottom fixture holes not visible. Applied force: 115 lbf <br>
Right: Deformation result of simulation. Maximum deformation seen in this case was 0.6934 in. <br>
This analysis was performed due to design judge complaints in previous years about excessive deformation (>2 in) when applying force to the side of the seat. The seat is made up of 4 plies angled at 0, 45, 90, and 45 degrees.

### Seated Driver Load

Left: Applied forces and fixtures used for simulation. Bottom fixture holes not visible. Applied force: 180 lbf (average driver weight) <br>
Middle: Deformation result of simulation. Maximum deformation seen in this case was 0.0704 in. <br>
Right: Equivalent stress result of simulation. Maximum stress seen in this case was . <br>
This analysis was performed to determine if reinforcement of bolt holes was necessary to prevent excessive stress at the mounting locations. The seat is made up of 4 plies angled at 0, 45, 90, and 45 degrees.

## Composite Fabrication
### Seat Mold Preparation
